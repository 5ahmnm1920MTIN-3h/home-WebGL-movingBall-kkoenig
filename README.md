# home-WebGL-movingBall-kkoenig

### Project description:
This simple project consists of a screen-independent canvas (960x600), a button (Move Ball), a text (title with developer name), a script (moving the ball with the button), and a GameObjects ball (sprite2d imported)

When pressing the button "Move Ball" the ball moves randomly to a new position. 4 Positions are available (4 empty GameObjects: PosBottomLeft, PosBottomRight, PosTopLeft, PosTopRight). There are 2 different variations for moving the ball to the positions randomly.

- Variation 1: direct repetition of the randomly chosen position is possible.
- Variation 2: the randomly chosen position is forced to be different, i.e. new position != old position

### Development platform:

- Windows 10 64 bit
- Unity Version: 2019.1.14f1
- Visual Studio Version: Visual Studio Community 2019 16.3.10
- Scripting Runtime Version: .NET 4.x Equivalent
- API Compatibility Level: .NET Standard 2.0

### Target platform:
WebGL incl. reference resolution 960x600

### Necessary setup/execution steps:
Installation process, e.g. step by step instructions so that I can run the project after cloning it.

WebGL has to be installed.

### Third party material:
(if used: Fonts, Sounds, Music, Graphics, Materials, Code, etc.)

### Project state:
incl. progress in percent

100%

### Limitations:
None

### Lessons Learned:

- Generate and use random numbers
- Use a script in combination with a button
- Build for the WebGL platform
- Publish a WebGL project on GitHub Pages via folder docs
